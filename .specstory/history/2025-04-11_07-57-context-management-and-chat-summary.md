Attached is the summary of the last chat as well as markdown logs of the chat so far. Please bring in anything that you need to because i'll stop including them shortly to save context

Okay, I have reviewed the attached history files and the previous conversation summary.

Based on that, here's my consolidated understanding of our current state and goals, particularly regarding the new project:

1.  **Project Goal:** We are creating a new project to replace and extend the functionality of a previous "Homelab Control Center (HCC)". This new project aims to manage homelab infrastructure components (like Proxmox, backups, Docker, network utilities).
2.  **Project Name:** We seem to be leaning towards "**InfraCore**" as the name for this new top-level repository in your workspace (`~/workspace/InfraCore`).
3.  **Core Principles:** The project must adhere to your established workspace principles:
    *   **Modularity:** Discrete, reusable components.
    *   **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring.
    *   **Portability:** Drop-in ready Git repositories.
    *   **Human Inspection:** Readable automation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Safeguards for automation.
    *   **Bash-first:** Core functionality in Bash for portability, potentially extending with other languages where needed.
    *   **Configuration as Code:** Version-controlled, human-readable configuration.
4.  **Proposed Structure:** I previously suggested a directory structure for `InfraCore` including folders like `bin/`, `modules/`, `config/`, `lib/`, `SystemDocs/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/`.
5.  **Initial Files:** I created a draft `InfraCore/README.md` outlining the project's purpose, structure, principles, and usage examples.

I have incorporated this context. I understand we are building the `InfraCore` project according to these principles and the proposed structure.

I am ready to proceed with the next steps for building out the `InfraCore` project based on this understanding.

actually i'm going to spin that off into its own workspace and context window so you can go back to focusing on system docs in workspace 

Please document whatever you need to in the /Users/evanacas/workspace/InfraCore/ directory

Understood. Before we switch contexts back to `SystemDocs`, I'll ensure the key decisions and structure we discussed for the new homelab management project are documented within the `/Users/evanacas/workspace/InfraCore/` directory.

Based on our previous interaction, the main artifact is the `README.md` file I created, which outlines the project name (`InfraCore`), its purpose, the proposed structure, and the core principles.

Let me quickly check the status of the `InfraCore` repository to see if the `README.md` and any other structural elements need committing.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/InfraCore && git status | cat
```

```bash
cd ~/workspace/InfraCore && git status | cat
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
        SystemDocs/
        bin/
        config/
        lib/
        modules/
        scripts/
        tests/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Okay, it looks like the `README.md` and the directory structure we discussed haven't been committed yet. I'll add them and create an initial commit to capture the project's foundation.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/InfraCore && git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial project structure and README for InfraCore"
```

```bash
cd ~/workspace/InfraCore && git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial project structure and README for InfraCore"
[main (root-commit) 4b8f8f1] feat: initial project structure and README for InfraCore
 8 files changed, 108 insertions(+)

 create mode 100644 modules/.DS_Store
 create mode 100644 scripts/.DS_Store
 create mode 100644 tests/.DS_Store
```

The initial structure and `README.md` for the `InfraCore` project are now committed in its own repository. This captures the essential information discussed, allowing you to manage it in a separate workspace context.

We can now return our focus to the `SystemDocs` project within the main workspace. What would you like to work on next within `SystemDocs`?
