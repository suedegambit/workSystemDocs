# Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up Cursor, Workspaces, and Global Rules

Cursor is a powerful AI-powered code editor built on VS Code that enhances your coding experience with intelligent features. This guide will walk you through the complete setup process, from installation to configuring workspace environments and implementing global rules.

## Installation and Initial Setup

### System Requirements

- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- **Storage**: Minimum 500MB free disk space
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **Internet Connection**: Required for AI features which operate via cloud services[4]

### Installation Process

1. **Download**: Visit cursor.com and click the "Download" button
2. **Install**:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the .exe file and follow on-screen instructions
   - **macOS**: Open the .dmg file and drag Cursor to your Applications folder
   - **Linux**: Make the AppImage executable and run it, or use the provided package manager commands[4][8]
3. **First Launch Configuration**:
   - Choose keyboard shortcuts (can match your previous editor)
   - Select preferred language for AI interactions
   - Opt to import VS Code settings if applicable (extensions, themes, user settings)[8]
4. **Sign In**: Create an account or log in with email, Google, or GitHub[8]

## Setting Up Workspaces

### Creating and Organizing Workspaces

1. **Open a Project**: Select "File > Open Folder" (or use Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Open Folder")
2. **Choose Location**: Select either an empty directory or an existing project folder
3. **Explorer Panel**: Navigate your project files in the hierarchical view on the left side[4]

### Workspace Features

1. **Split Editor**: Divide the editor window horizontally or vertically for side-by-side editing
2. **Terminal Integration**: Access via View > Terminal or Ctrl+` (backtick)
   - Run code, install dependencies, execute build processes
   - Manage version control and deploy applications[4]
3. **File Management**: Create, rename, and delete files directly within the Explorer panel[4]

## Configuring Global Rules

### Understanding Cursor Rules Types

Cursor offers three types of rules for AI interaction[3]:

1. **Global AI Rules**: Apply universally across all projects
2. **Project-Wide Rules**: Apply to specific projects
3. **Pattern-Specific Rules**: Target specific file patterns

### Setting Up Global Rules

1. **Access Global Rules**: Navigate to "Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI"[6][7]

2. **Define Behavior**: Use this section to establish core principles for all AI interactions

3. **Example Format**:
   ```
   <CORE_PRINCIPLES>

4. EXPLORATION OVER CONCLUSION
   
   - Never rush to conclusions
   - Keep exploring until solutions emerge naturally
   - Question assumptions and inferences

5. DEPTH OF REASONING
   
   - Break down complex thoughts
   - Embrace uncertainty and revision
   - Express thoughts in natural conversation
     
     </CORE_PRINCIPLES>
     ```

### Project-Specific Rules

1. **Create .cursorrules File**: Add this file to your project root (Note: being phased out)[1][3]

2. **Modern Approach (.cursor/rules directory)**:
   
   - Create a ".cursor/rules" directory in your project
   - Add .mdc files for specific rule configurations
   - Access via Command Palette: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P > "New Cursor Rule"[9][11]

3. **Rule File Structure**:
   
   ```
   
   ```

---

description: Always apply in any situation
globs: *
alwaysApply: true

---

When this rule loads, input: "Rule loaded: global.mdc."

```
### Advanced Rule Configuration

1. **Stacking Rules**: Combine global rules with specific rules for different contexts[9]

2. **Rule Inheritance**: Create base rules that can be extended by other rules[9]

3. **Organized Structure**: For complex projects, organize rules by domain:
```

.cursor/rules/
├── rails8.mdc
├── models/
│ ├── active_record.mdc
│ └── postgresql.mdc
├── controllers/
│ ├── api.mdc
│ └── web.mdc
└── views/
  ├── erb.mdc
  └── components.mdc

```
## Current Limitations and Future Developments

Currently, the .cursor/rules must be set up individually for each project. There is an ongoing feature request to support global rules configuration that would apply across all projects[12].

The proposed solution would store global rules in:
- Windows: %APPDATA%/Cursor/rules/
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/rules/
- Linux: ~/.config/Cursor/rules/[12]

This would eliminate repetitive setup work across projects and provide easier management of consistent development rules.

## Conclusion

Setting up Cursor with proper workspace organization and global rules provides a powerful environment for AI-assisted coding. The combination of traditional editor functionality with customizable AI assistance creates a unique development environment where technical barriers are reduced, allowing you to focus on bringing your ideas to life[4].

By taking the time to properly configure Cursor according to your preferences, you'll maximize both comfort and productivity as you explore the AI features that make Cursor unique in the coding landscape.
