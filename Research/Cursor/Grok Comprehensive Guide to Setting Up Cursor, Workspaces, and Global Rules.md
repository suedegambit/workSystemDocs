### Key Points
- It seems likely that "cursor, workspace, and global rules" refers to setting up the Cursor AI code editor, a tool for coding with AI assistance.
- Research suggests that setting up involves installing the tool, creating a workspace (a project directory), and configuring global rules for AI behavior.
- The evidence leans toward workspaces being directories containing projects, with global rules applying application-wide and project-specific rules for individual projects.

### Setting Up the Cursor Tool
To get started with the Cursor AI code editor, download and install it from [the official website](https://www.cursor.com). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system, then launch the application and sign in or create an account. The interface is similar to VS Code, making it user-friendly for developers.

### Creating a Workspace
In Cursor, a workspace is typically a directory or folder that holds your projects. To create one, make a new directory on your file system and open it in Cursor using "Open Folder" from the File menu (Ctrl + O on Windows/Linux, Cmd + O on macOS). You can also open existing project directories as workspaces.

### Setting Global and Project-Specific Rules
Global rules, which apply to all projects, are set in Cursor Settings under General > Rules for AI. Input custom instructions here for the AI's behavior. For project-specific rules, create a `.cursor/rules` directory in each project's root and add `.mdc` files with tailored rules, which can override global settings.

### Survey Note: Detailed Guidance on Setting Up Cursor, Workspace, and Global Rules

#### Introduction to Cursor AI Code Editor
Cursor is an AI-powered code editor designed to enhance coding productivity, built on top of VS Code with additional AI features for code completion, refactoring, and more. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows. Given the user's query, it seems likely that "cursor" refers to this tool, given the prevalence of related search results and community discussions.

The setup process involves installing the application, creating or opening workspaces (interpreted as project directories), and configuring rules to tailor AI behavior. These rules are categorized into global rules, which apply application-wide, and project-specific rules, with ongoing discussions about workspace-level rules indicating potential future enhancements.

#### Setting Up the Cursor Tool
To begin, users must download and install Cursor from [the official website](https://www.cursor.com). The installation process is straightforward, with options for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once installed, launching the application prompts users to sign in or create an account, ensuring access to all features, including a 14-day free trial of the Pro plan without requiring a credit card.

The interface, based on VS Code, allows for easy import of extensions, themes, and keybindings, making it familiar for developers. All AI features are opt-in, providing flexibility for users to customize their experience. This setup is crucial for ensuring the tool integrates well with existing development environments.

#### Understanding and Creating a Workspace
The concept of a "workspace" in Cursor appears to align with a directory or folder containing one or more projects. Community discussions, such as those on the Cursor forum, mention "multi-project workspaces," suggesting that a workspace can encompass multiple projects within a single directory. To create a workspace:

- Create a new directory on your file system using File Explorer, Finder, or Terminal.
- Open this directory in Cursor by selecting "Open Folder" from the File menu or using the shortcut Ctrl + O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + O (macOS).
- For existing projects, open their root directories as workspaces, allowing Cursor to analyze and assist with coding tasks within that context.

This interpretation is supported by tutorials and guides, such as [a step-by-step guide on Medium](https://medium.com/%40niall.mcnulty/step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-cursor-ai-66cb6fc14017), which emphasize opening folders to start coding, reinforcing the idea that workspaces are project directories.

#### Configuring Global and Project-Specific Rules
Rules in Cursor are instructions for the AI, influencing its behavior during coding sessions. These are divided into global rules and project-specific rules, with ongoing community interest in workspace-level rules.

**Global Rules:**
- Global rules apply to all projects across all workspaces within the Cursor application. They are configured in the Settings UI under General > Rules for AI.
- To access, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and select "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)." Navigate to the General section and locate "Rules for AI."
- Here, users can input custom system messages, such as coding style preferences or specific AI instructions (e.g., "Be terse, suggest solutions I didn't think about"). These settings ensure consistent AI behavior across all coding sessions.

**Project-Specific Rules:**
- Each project can have its own set of rules, stored in a `.cursor/rules` directory within the project's root. These rules allow for granular control, tailoring AI behavior to the project's needs.
- To set up, navigate to the project's root directory, create a `.cursor/rules` directory if absent, and add `.mdc` files with specific rules. For example, a rule might specify, "You are a TypeScript expert, provide guidance on type systems."
- These rules can override or complement global rules, providing flexibility for different projects within the same workspace.

Community discussions, such as [a forum post on workspace rules](https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-rules-files-for-multi-project-workspace/48086), highlight the desire for workspace-level rules, which would apply to all projects within a workspace but not globally. Currently, such a feature is not explicitly supported, with users managing multi-project needs through project-specific rules or global settings.

#### Advanced Rule Management and Considerations
Cursor supports advanced rule management, such as using glob patterns to apply rules to specific file types or paths. For instance, a rule might apply to all `.tsx` files using a glob pattern like `*.tsx`, ensuring AI responses are tailored to TypeScript React components. This is detailed in [a comprehensive guide on Cursor Rules](https://cursor101.com/cursor/rules), which provides examples and best practices.

The ability to reference other files via `@file` directives in rules allows for chaining multiple rules, enhancing context for the AI. Users can create new rules using the Command Palette with Cmd + Shift + P > New Cursor Rule, and these are version-controlled as regular files, integrating with Git workflows.

#### Challenges and Community Feedback
There is some controversy around the lack of workspace-level rules, with users requesting features like a global `.cursor/rules` directory for user-level rules applicable to all projects, as seen in [a feature request on the forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/global-cursor-rules-directory/50049). This suggests a gap in current functionality, where users must rely on global rules for application-wide settings or manage project-specific rules individually, which can be cumbersome for multi-project workspaces.

Additionally, discussions indicate that Cursor's AI may struggle with complex bug detection or context retention after breaks, as noted in [a tutorial on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/cursor-ai-code-editor). Users are encouraged to iterate with the AI, treating it like pair programming, to refine outputs and ensure accuracy.

#### Conclusion
Setting up Cursor involves installing the application, creating workspaces by opening project directories, and configuring global rules in Settings > General > Rules for AI for application-wide AI behavior. Project-specific rules can be set in each project's `.cursor/rules` directory for customized assistance. While workspace-level rules are not currently supported, community feedback suggests ongoing development in this area, reflecting the tool's evolving nature.
