## Inbox Flow

- Captures enter `OutBrain/Inbox/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Entries may include timestamp + tags + freeform content
- During processing, entries can:
  - Be filed into GTD `Projects/` or `NextActions.md`
  - Be transformed into OutBrain memos
  - Trigger agentic action
  - Be archived

Capture is fast. Review is thoughtful. Filing is structured.
