# Task Backlog

*Planned tasks for SystemDocs.*

---

- [ ] #prio/low #type/docs Flesh out planned sections in `structure.md` (Agent Flow, Processing Patterns, sync strategy, etc.) *(Started - added initial thoughts)*.
- [ ] #prio/low #type/feature Implement suggestions from `commit-automation.md` (hooks, scripts) if desired.
- [ ] #prio/low #type/docs Add the visual architecture diagram to `structure.md`.
- [ ] #prio/medium #type/tooling Ensure `ws-head` alias from `system-rules.md` is implemented and functional *(Requires manual addition to shell profile, e.g., ~/.zshrc)*.
- [ ] #prio/low #type/design #scope/agentic Consider and design how we might describe capture and measure criteria for the project tasks system to potentially allow at times unsupervised agentic delivery of these tasks.
- [ ] #prio/medium #type/alignment Create tasks for MCP to address alignment gaps:
  - Consolidate duplicated documentation between `README.md` and `cursorrules.md`
  - Clean up and standardize backlog entries
  - Evaluate moving general-purpose scripts to Tooling repo
  - Standardize error handling approaches
  - Ensure consistent references to SystemDocs
- [ ] #prio/medium #type/research Develop workspace terminology glossary:
  - Use research parameters from `ResearchParametersforWorkspaceTerminologyGlossary-fromTooling.md` 
  - Take light-touch approach for first round (focus on most common/critical terms)
  - Allow system to "bed in" for 1-2 months before comprehensive implementation
  - Balance standardization with project-specific terminology needs
