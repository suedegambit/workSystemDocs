## Content
We have recently completed several alignment tasks for the GTD project based on workspace standards, including:

1. Created cursorrules.md and .cursor/rules/rules.md with standard sections
2. Updated README.md with a Workspace Context section
3. Created a standardized project template
4. Implemented NextActions.md format with automation
5. Added GTD workflow documentation
6. Reorganized project files according to standards

Should we now submit a formal subproject alignment measure based on the criteria in our `projectTasks/subproject_alignment_prompt.md`? If so, what is the preferred process for submitting this alignment report?

## Expected Response
yes
