## Response Content
Thank you for completing these alignment tasks for the GTD project. The progress you've made is excellent.

Yes, a formal alignment measure would be valuable at this stage. Here's the process:

1. **Self-Assessment**: 
   - Use the template in `~/workspace/SystemDocs/projectTasks/subproject_alignment_prompt.md`
   - Complete the checklist analysis for your project
   - Calculate your current alignment score

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create a file named `GTDAlignmentReport.md` in your project root
   - Include the completed checklist, score, identified gaps, and next steps
   - Document any justified exceptions with rationale

3. **Submission**:
   - Send the completed report via interop (GTD → SystemDocs)
   - Reference the report location in your message

For your convenience, you can use our standard format from successfully aligned projects (like Tooling). We recommend focusing especially on:
- README.md workspace context
- Task management standardization
- Script logging conventions (if applicable)
- Documentation structure

## Follow-up Required
no
