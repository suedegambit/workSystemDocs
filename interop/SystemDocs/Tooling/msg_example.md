## Request Type
notification

## Priority
low

## Content
This is an example message demonstrating the new cross-project communication framework. The framework has been implemented in `~/workspace/SystemDocs/interop/` with the following components:

1. Standardized message and response formats
2. A registry tracking system at `~/workspace/SystemDocs/interop/registry.md`
3. Templates for messages and responses
4. Directory structure for organized communication

A symlink to the interop directory should appear in your project root soon, allowing direct access to this system. The symlink will be created using the `setup_symlinks.sh` script.

Each project should add the following to their cursor rules:

```
