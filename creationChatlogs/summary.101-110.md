## Summary
- User asks how to check `git status` for all `~/workspace/` repos in one go.
- Assistant provides a scriptable approach (`gst-all`) that loops through subdirectories and runs `git status`.
- User requests this pattern be documented as part of the standard `SystemDocs`, since they'll often "wear two hats" and want this workspace to be *drop-inable* across machines.
- Conversation shifts toward productivity reflectionsâ€”user notes it's now Monday morning and they haven't completed weekend goals, highlighting fear of losing context.
- Mentions upcoming Tuesday talk on AI in finance for a non-technical audience, unprepared so far.
- Assistant affirms principles and structure laid so far *will support recovering momentum* and navigating unfinished work.

## Questions Needing Answering
- Should `gst-all` ignore folders not under Git to reduce noise?
- Should `SystemDocs` include a checklist for new machine setup and Git configuration?

## Questions Answered
- Yes, looping through `~/workspace/*/` and checking `.git` presence is effective.
- Yes, `gst-all` should become part of documented conventions under `Tooling`.

## Decisions Made
- `gst-all` becomes a standard workspace diagnostic command.
- A "two hats" assumption (work + personal) guides SSH and repo structure going forward.
- All tooling and logging practices should be consistently documentable + replicable.

## Human Action Items
- Create `Tooling/scripts/gst-all.sh`
- Document `gst-all` usage in `Tooling/README.md` and `SystemDocs/WorkspaceOps.md`
- Draft outline for Tuesday's AI-in-finance talk
