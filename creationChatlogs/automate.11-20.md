## Automatable Actions

- Create empty README stubs in all cloned workspace folders  
```sh
for dir in ~/workspace/*/; do
  [ -d "$dir/.git" ] && echo "# $(basename "$dir")" > "$dir/README.md"
done
```

- Add `.gitignore` to exclude `logs/` directory  
```text
~/workspace/.gitignore
```
```text
logs/
```

- Create `~/workspace/logs/.keep` to preserve directory in Git-free context  
```text
~/workspace/logs/.keep
```
```text
This placeholder file ensures the logs directory exists for automated output.
```

- Create a Git config snippet that can be appended for repo remotes using alias  
```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github-suedegambit:suedegambit/REPO_NAME.git
```

- Write placeholder file for `~/workspace/Agents/README.md` to capture agent component guidelines  
```markdown
# Agents

This folder stores persistent state and working files for long-running personal agents:
- Email assistant
- Log analyzer
- MCP-extended tools

Future: consider structured naming and checkpoint files per agent.
