## Summary
- User requests a current summary of action items and required documentation.
- Raises a smart question about the value of logging `gst-all` output vs simply committing and pushing.
- Concludes that logging serves observability and context preservation, not just code tracking.
- Introduces the second foundational principle: **rate-limited automation during early implementation**, to ensure agentic processes are human-observable and debuggable.
- Confirms that both principles (action-before-leaving + rate-limited execution) should be formally documented in `SystemDocs`.

## Questions Needing Answering
- Should `gst-all` output be periodically rotated or summarized?
- What is the best format for future automation logs to support context-aware review?

## Questions Answered
- Logging `git status` is useful for context preservation, auditing, and observabilityâ€”even if not committing.
- Rate-limiting agent processes during early implementation provides debuggability and safety.

## Decisions Made
- Principle 1: *Never leave the machine without kicking off, assisting, or logging an automated process.*
- Principle 2: *During early implementation, all automation should be rate-limited and human-observable.*
- These principles are to be codified in `SystemDocs/Principles.md`.

## Human Action Items
- Write `Principles.md` and log both foundational rules.
- Add logging/observability guidance to `WorkspaceOps.md`
- Add example use of `gst-all` and its value for async work or distributed state
