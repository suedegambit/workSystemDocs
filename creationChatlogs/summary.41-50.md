## Summary
- User confirms use of a custom `.ssh/config` file and verifies successful cloning of all `work*` repos under `~/workspace/`.
- Asks how to quickly cycle through each workspace directory to check Git status (`git status`).
- Decides this pattern should become a standard and be documented in `SystemDocs`.
- User expresses frustration at not making enough progress over the weekend and concern about losing context.
- Mentions upcoming AI in finance talk (Tuesday), not yet prepared.

## Questions Needing Answering
- Should the `gst-all` script evolve to include optional auto-commit or context tagging?
- How should context recovery happen from logs and inbox?

## Questions Answered
- Cycling through and running `git status` can be automated via a shell loop (`gst-all`).
- Yes, this convention should be formalized and included in `SystemDocs`.

## Decisions Made
- The `gst-all` pattern is now a standard convention and must be part of workspace documentation.
- All `~/workspace/` repos should support this loop-based operation.
- `SystemDocs` is the single source of truth for standards like this.

## Human Action Items
- Finalize and prepare slides/outline for the Tuesday AI in finance talk.
- Add `gst-all` to `~/workspace/Tooling/aliases.zsh` or equivalent
- Write section in `SystemDocs/WorkspaceOps.md` explaining `gst-all`
- Do a structured context capture (inbox dump) before sleep or transition
