## Summary
- User expresses clear anxiety about context loss and low weekend productivity despite extensive system setup.
- Reiterates goal of maintaining flow by always logging, acting, or kicking off a process before walking away.
- Requests a fresh action + doc list based on the entire thread so far.
- Revisits `gst-all` and whether logging its output has real value; decides it does for context preservation and diff-checking.
- Introduces **rate-limited automation** as second foundational system principle to enforce observability during early stages.
- Requests dual-codeblock structured summaries to continue with turn-based indexing.
- Turns 1–70 summaries are completed in prior responses; format validated.

## Questions Needing Answering
- Should workspace shell startup log outstanding git status diffs?
- How can we safely monitor agentic actions and ensure nothing is missed?

## Questions Answered
- Yes, logging `gst-all` snapshots helps preserve incomplete state across sessions.
- Principles are not just guidelines—they should influence system architecture and automation gating.

## Decisions Made
- Finalized second foundational principle: *rate-limited agentic automation during early-stage implementation.*
- Summarization convention with automatable blocks will continue.
- `gst-all` logging is validated as a meaningful observability step.

## Human Action Items
- Create visual summary/diagram of system principles, structure, and flow.
- Begin early implementation of log review pipelines (even just markdown parsing).
- Include automation sanity checks on process exit or logout triggers (TBD later).
