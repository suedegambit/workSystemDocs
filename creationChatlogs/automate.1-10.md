  for d in ~/workspace/*/; do
    if [ -d "$d/.git" ]; then
      echo "ðŸŒ€ $d"
      (cd "$d" && git status)
      echo ""
    fi
  done

  ## System Principles

  ### 1. No Idle Exit Without Action
  *Never leave the machine without attending to, kicking off, or logging an automated process.*

  ### 2. Rate-Limited Implementation
  *All early-stage automation must include deliberate pacing to ensure processes remain human-observable and debuggable.*
