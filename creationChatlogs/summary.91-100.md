## Summary
- User asks for a structured summary of all previously discussed turns, including automatable actions and human tasks.
- Confirms the dual-codeblock summary structure is working and wants it maintained moving forward.
- Asks for repo descriptions for `~/workspace/` repos (`workGTD`, `workTooling`, `workOutBrain`, `workSystemDocs`, etc.).
- Reports authentication failures when cloning from GitHub and begins diagnosing SSH config issues.
- Proceeds to create a new personal SSH key (`id_ed25519_suedegambit`) for GitHub personal use.
- Updates `~/.ssh/config` to include both `github-suedegambit` and default `github.com` entries for personal and work accounts.
- Tests and confirms cloning works correctly when using the `github-suedegambit` host override.
- Clones all personal `work*` repos into their expected paths inside `~/workspace/`.

## Questions Needing Answering
- Should we formalize a `workspace.json` or `.workspace.yml` for describing all repo purposes and paths?
- Should each repo have a local `README.md` and be cross-indexed from `SystemDocs`?

## Questions Answered
- Yes, using named SSH host entries (e.g., `github-suedegambit`) is effective for multi-identity workflows.
- Personal keys and SSH agent loading can be scoped cleanly using `IdentityFile` and `IdentitiesOnly yes`.

## Decisions Made
- GitHub access now split between work and personal using clean SSH configuration.
- Repo naming convention: all personal repos use `work*` prefix (e.g., `workGTD`, `workTooling`).
- Each `~/workspace/` repo should have a clear description, README, and defined purpose.

## Human Action Items
- Write descriptive README.md files for each `work*` repo.
- Document SSH setup in `SystemDocs/auth.md` or `SystemDocs/git.md`.
- Evaluate whether to create `.workspace.yml` to formalize repo metadata (path, description, sync status).
