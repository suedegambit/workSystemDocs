# Consolidated Project Summary (Derived from Turns 1-110)

## Project Evolution Summary

This project initiated with the goal of building a local, extensible, personal agentic AI system focused on enhancing productivity through structured context retention (PKM) and task management (GTD). Key drivers included overcoming context loss between sessions and integrating LLM capabilities strategically rather than tactically.

Early phases involved defining core principles like "No Idle Exit Without Action" and later "Rate-Limited Automation for Observability." The foundational structure of a modular `~/workspace` was established, comprising separate Git repositories (`workGTD`, `workTooling`, `workOutBrain`, `workSystemDocs`, `workAgents` [planned]) using the `workNAME` convention. A distinction was made between version-controlled content and machine-generated, non-versioned logs (`~/workspace/logs/`).

Significant effort went into solving practical setup issues, notably configuring SSH keys for separate personal (`github-suedegambit` alias) and work identities to interact correctly with GitHub.

Core system components and workflows were designed, including:
*   A GTD capture workflow using `GTD/inbox.md`.
*   An `OutBrain/Inbox/` for less structured thought capture.
*   A convention for documenting the system itself within `workSystemDocs`.
*   Tooling like the `gst-all` script for workspace Git status monitoring, including logging capabilities.

The process involved using ChatGPT interactively, generating structured summaries and automatable action lists (`creationChatlogs/`), which were then processed (initially by Cursor) to bootstrap the system's files and documentation. Concerns about focus (ADHD) led to emphasizing low-friction capture and future agentic delegation for deep-dive tasks. A trust model for different AI tools (Cursor for execution, ChatGPT for ideation, Claude for review) emerged.

## Key Decisions Made

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Adopt a modular `~/workspace` structure.
    *   Use separate Git repositories for `GTD`, `Tooling`, `OutBrain`, `SystemDocs`, (and `Agents` later).
    *   Employ the `workNAME` convention for repository naming.
    *   Establish `workSystemDocs` as the canonical source for documentation, principles, and conventions.
    *   Use `~/workspace` as the canonical project root.
    *   Store agent working files tentatively in `~/workspace/Agents/`.
*   **Logging & Data Handling:**
    *   Separate machine-generated logs (`~/workspace/logs/`) from human/capture content.
    *   `logs/` directory is explicitly excluded from Git tracking.
    *   Logging `git status` (`gst-all`) is useful for observability and context preservation, distinct from committing. Logs are orthogonal to Git history.
*   **Core Principles:**
    *   Adopt Principle 1: "Never leave the laptop without attending to, kicking off, or logging an automated process."
    *   Adopt Principle 2: "During early implementation, all automation should be rate-limited and human-observable."
    *   Principle-based design guides all system development.
*   **Capture & Workflow:**
    *   Use `GTD/inbox.md` for structured GTD capture snippets.
    *   Use `OutBrain/Inbox/` for less structured thought capture, processed later.
    *   Establish Inbox flow (Capture -> Review -> Dispatch) as a core mechanism.
*   **Tooling & Automation:**
    *   Implement `gst-all` script as a standard workspace diagnostic tool.
    *   Logging capability to be included in `gst-all` (optional).
    *   Use standard tooling (`find`, `ls`, shell scripts) for workspace operations.
    *   Utilize the structured summary/automate format generated by ChatGPT for bootstrapping.
*   **Configuration & Access:**
    *   Separate work/personal Git identities using `~/.ssh/config` and host aliases (`github-suedegambit` for personal).
    *   Use `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_suedegambit` key for personal access.
    *   Workspace should be "drop-inable" across machines, assuming configuration (`.ssh/config`, aliases) is replicated.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Each `work*` repository must have a README explaining its purpose and structure.
    *   Maintain documentation standards suitable for humans and agents.
    *   Use `SystemDocs` to document structure, workflows, principles, setup, etc.
    *   Codify principles in `SystemDocs/Principles.md`.
    *   Document log conventions and `gst-all` usage in `SystemDocs/WorkspaceOps.md`.

## Open Questions (Consolidated)

*   How can ChatGPT (or similar non-filesystem-aware tools) interact with Markdown GTD stores *before* full MCP integration?
*   Where should persistent context data (like vector stores) and long-running agent state (e.g., email assistant) live within the `~/workspace/Agents/` structure?
*   What is the optimal long-term plan/mechanism for syncing and processing the non-Git `logs/` directory (Unraid, Drive, automated processing)?
*   Where should raw vs processed logs ultimately reside? Should processed logs/summaries be committed?
*   What is the minimal viable structure for `Inbox` entries (GTD & OutBrain) to reliably support automated triage?
*   Where should metadata (context, intent, tags) ideally be stored for captured items (frontmatter, inline, filename)?
*   Should `Agents/` contain runtime environments (binaries/venvs) or just state/config?
*   What's the best long-term convention for syncing `OutBrain` data between machines?
*   Should a formal `workspace.yml` (or similar) be maintained to describe repo metadata?
*   Should each repo's README be cross-indexed from `SystemDocs`?
*   How to best handle non-Git folders in `gst-all` output (or should it strictly ignore them)?
*   Should `SystemDocs` include a detailed checklist/script for new machine setup?
*   Should `gst-all` evolve to include optional auto-commit or context tagging features?
*   How should context recovery optimally happen from logs and inbox review?
*   Should a daily snapshot log of git status be automated (e.g., via cron)?
*   Should agents be allowed to push commits autonomously, or only stage changes for review?
*   What is the best format for future *automation* logs (agent actions, etc.) to support context-aware review and debugging?
*   How to best visualize the overall system structure and workflow?
*   How to ensure system principles are consistently applied and measured?
*   How to standardize log formats across different tools/agents?
*   Should the workspace shell startup proactively notify about outstanding Git status diffs?
*   How can agentic actions be monitored safely and reliably to ensure nothing critical is missed?
